This Rimworld mod adds the ability to Auto Sell items from the trade window using a set of editable rules.  These rules can be created and edited via the Autosell Tab.

So, You've been hoarding a ton of weapons and apparel you've been hoping to sell, or you're frequently harvesting and selling something, but you're getting sick of adjusting sliders for all your hundreds of items.  This is mod will make your life easier.  After you setup your rules for selling on the overview tab, selling will be only one button press away.

you can create rules for damage equipment, sell only of a certain quality, or even items made from a certain material.  Do you have a surplus of stock but don't want to sell everything, you can do that aswell.

If AI Selling is enabled it will, by default give a job to the best negotiator avaibable, some social skill is also gained during the job.

when Improved Stack behaviour is enabled, it will treat similar items of differently values as one stack, so that if you have a keep value of 5, you'll only be left with 5 of that item type (rather than keeping 5 in each different valued stack).  If you prefer the old behaviour, or if you think it's causing problems with trading, it can be turned off.
